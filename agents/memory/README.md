# Agent Memory

Durable working memory for coding agents operating in this repository. Hermes (and
any other agent) compresses long conversations; these files are the deliberate,
intelligent form of that compression: hand-curated state that survives context
loss, written in the codebase where the work happens.

## Rules

1. **Read before working.** Load the index table below and any file matching your
   task. Trust code, gates, and `git log` over these notes when they disagree.
2. **Update after every slice.** When a work item's status, key decisions,
   evidence locations, or next step changes, update its file in the same turn —
   do not end the turn on stale state.
3. **One file per active work item.** Name files by topic slug
   (`f10-plan-mode-enforcement.md`, not `notes3.md`). Keep each file under ~80
   lines: status, decisions, changed files, evidence paths, next steps.
4. **Working state, not product docs.** Product truth lives in `docs/` and
   `audit/`. These files record *where work stands*: what is verified, what is
   pending, what was decided and why. Never put secrets or credentials here.
5. **Delete on completion.** When a work item's changes are fully committed and
   its documentation landed in `docs/milestones/`, delete its file here. The
   commit history is the durable record; this folder holds only open work.

## Index

| File | Work item | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| *(no open items — F02 landed in a160b8d, F10 in e778ab3; next roadmap item F09 starts a file here when begun)* | | |
