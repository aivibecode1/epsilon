# Agent Memory

Durable working memory for coding agents operating in this repository. Hermes (and
any other agent) compresses long conversations; these files are the deliberate,
intelligent form of that compression: hand-curated state that survives context
loss, written in the codebase where the work happens.

## Rules

1. **Read before working.** Load the index table below and any file matching your
   task. Trust code, gates, and `git log` over these notes when they disagree.
2. **Update after every slice.** When a work item's status, key decisions,
   evidence locations, or next step changes, update its file in the same turn —
   do not end the turn on stale state.
3. **One file per active work item.** Name files by topic slug
   (`f10-plan-mode-enforcement.md`, not `notes3.md`). Keep each file under ~80
   lines: status, decisions, changed files, evidence paths, next steps.
4. **Working state, not product docs.** Product truth lives in `docs/` and
   `audit/`. These files record *where work stands*: what is verified, what is
   pending, what was decided and why. Never put secrets or credentials here.
5. **Retire only after closeout.** Keep a work item until its documentation,
   verification, installation (when required), and cleanup are complete. Then
   move durable findings to the milestone/ledger and remove the working note.
6. **Checkpoint before context loss.** Before a large handoff or likely context
   compaction, save the current goal, verified facts versus assumptions, decisions,
   blockers, exact evidence paths, running process IDs, dirty-work boundaries,
   and the next safe action. Update existing topic files instead of appending a
   transcript. Read only the index and relevant topics when resuming.

Hermes performs context compression; these files preserve curated recovery state,
not a lossless copy of chat. The active default profile was verified with automatic
compression enabled, a 0.50 threshold and a 0.20 target ratio. Repository notes do
not themselves trigger runtime compression.
